# PyBer_Analysis
Code uses pandas to parse through data about cities, drivers, and riders in order to extract and organize data. Then uses matplotlib and create charts.
# Summary DataFrame
As is seen in the image below, the Urban city type had the highest percentage of total rides out of the three city types. They also had the highest number of drivers, and the highest average number of drivers per city.

From the summary dataframe, we can see that the total volume of rides and consequently the total fare value was higher in the urban city type. However, the average fare per ride was lower in these Urban areas, likely due to a shift in the quantity supplied. Therefore, the average fare per driver was noticeably lower. We can also see that the total number of drivers is larger than the total number of rides, which results in the average fare per driver being lower than the average fare per ride for urban cities.
